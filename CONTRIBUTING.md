## Contributing to EmberWatch

EmberWatch is a community-driven resource. Anyone is welcome to contribute.

We would invite you to visit our GitHub repository at [EmberWatch Github Repo](https://github.com/emberwatch/emberwatch) where you can create __Issues__ and __Pull Requests__.

The site is currently running above Jekyll, a static site generator. (More on this...)

### Ways to contribute

#### Suggesting content

If you don't think creating a `Pull Request (PR)` is workable now, you can share some links to resources that you think would benefit the Ember.js community by creating issues.

#### Raising issues you encounter when using the site

Feedback is a valuable thing for helping us know some aspects of the site that is not working as expected.

#### Addressing issues

If you find issues that you want to address yourself, you can go ahead and create a `Pull Request (PR)` and submit them so can we work on having it address the issue.

#### Creating PRs directly

Though creating an issue first would give us an opportunity to talk about the issue and have a means to validate that our solution in our PR would smoothly integrate into our site, It is not a requirement. You can create and submit PRs right away.
